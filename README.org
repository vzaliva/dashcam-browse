* Vsysto motorcycle dashcam web browser

By default, the camera creates its own WiFi network to which you
connect from your mobile phone using a mobile app. I found this
inconvenient for several reasons: 1) downloading huge files to a
mobile phone is not practical; 2) I want to download them to my
computer for video editing and post-processing.

Instead, using this script, you can configure your camera to connect
to your home WiFi network and then download files directly to your Mac
or PC using your web browser.

** Hardware

** Configure your Camera

   In order to configure your camera, you need to connect to it from your laptop or mobile
   phone and open series of URL's configuring it to access your local WiFi network.
   Assuming your WiFi have SSID /mynet/ and password /mypass/ perform the following steps:

    1. http://192.72.1.1/cgi-bin/Config.cgi?action=set&property=Net.WIFI_STA.AP.1.SSID&value=mynet
    2. http://192.72.1.1/cgi-bin/Config.cgi?action=set&property=Net.WIFI_STA.AP.1.CryptoKey&value=mypass
    3. http://192.72.1.1/cgi-bin/Config.cgi?action=set&property=Net.WIFI_STA.AP.1.EncType&value=AES
    4. http://192.72.1.1/cgi-bin/Config.cgi?action=set&property=Net.Dev.2.Start&value=1
    5. http://192.72.1.1/cgi-bin/Config.cgi?action=set&property=Net.Dev.1.Start&value=0
    6. http://192.72.1.1/cgi-bin/Config.cgi?action=set&property=Net&value=reset

    (after the last step camera will restart and should reconnect to your WiFi)
